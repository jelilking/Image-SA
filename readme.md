# Image Search App

## Overview

This is a simple Image Search App that allows users to search for images using keywords. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages the power of a third-party image search API to fetch and display relevant images based on user queries.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The app provides a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with the application.

- **Dynamic Image Search:** Users can enter keywords in the search bar, and the app dynamically fetches and displays images related to the entered query.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the web pages is created using HTML.

- **CSS:** Styling and layout are handled with CSS to ensure a visually appealing and consistent look.

- **JavaScript:** The app uses JavaScript to handle user interactions, make asynchronous requests to the image search API, and dynamically update the content.

## Getting Started
